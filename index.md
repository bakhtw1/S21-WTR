Software Development Engineer I Intern

Summer 2021

## About

This blog details the experiences I had during my work term spent as a SDE I at Amazon Canada located in Toronto, On. This was a major stepping stone in my undergraduate career since this is the first expereience I had with a major multinational company where work I conducted could impact many users around the world. 

## Amazon Canada

Many are familiar with the services provided by Amazon, and know of the sheer size and scale of the ambitions it has as a company. From entertainment to e-commerce to cloud services and everything inbetween it's more than likely that Amazon has some sort of relevancy in many industries. The one I was invloved in is the ever growing industry of Advertising. Amazon has big incentive to make a strong push into the Adspace industry on the web and certainly has the online real estate to do so. 

## Job Description

An SDE at Amazon can expect a few thing that are fairly similar to other workplaces (such as ones I have worked in past internships), but there are many things that are much different than anywhere else. As an intern at Amazon, you are presented with a project which you will work for the entirety of the internship. To assist you in your stuggles a mentor is assigned to you where he or she provides important insight, shares knowledge and experience, and not only regarding work but valuable advice regarding the crazy fast paced software development industry. This project is broken up into milestones where much of the time is taken in preparing a design and discussing this design with the team. At the end of your internship you must present your finished project not only with the team but with the entire organization. This is a daunting task but is made easier by friendly and supportive co-workers not only from your direct team but the whole organization. 

## Goals

### Goal 1: Become familiar with the concept of Visual Regression Testing, and how it will benefit the team, and improve the products that our team owns. Also using this knowledge, help the team decide which technology we should use to perform our visual testing.

My project was mainly involved in implementing a new testing service for front end regressions. This is important for our team since product releases go directly to the customer, and we can't afford to have any visual errors, also known as "regressions", in our product. So My project was to implement a system for catching visual regressions before they were released 
to production. This involved much research into the weird and wacky world of software testing and provided an introduction for me into some of the visual regression tools available. I realized also the extent of this problem through my research into finding some good options for our team. It seems that this is a problem that people are desperately trying to find efficient solutions for and there are new tools constantly being produced. Using the most popular and widely supported option I presented my findings to the team and decided on a framework to use for a prototype. 

### Goal 2: Improve and develop presentation and demo skills. An important aspect of software engineering is demonstrating the products you have developed, so improving your presentation skills is crucial to becoming an effective software engineer.

One aspect of working at Amazon that greatly differs from any previous experiences is the amount of communication and presentation that is required. Engineers are constantly going back and forth with team members and people from other teams. Alongside all this there are demoes of products occuring on a weekly basis on a variety of topics and products that engineering around the organization have been working on. One thing that sets this apart from other places is the quality of presentations, everyone is really great and very confident and excellent at presenting and public speaking. One thing I would like to develop my skills in is public speaking and presenting to large audiences. This is one thing that I had great practice with, on a small scale with my team, and on the large scale with everyone from our organization so its something that I have some experience with but still could use more practice.

### Goal 3: Develop a product that can be used not only for our team but all teams where this type of testing could be useful.

The major goal is not only to improve our teams product, but also to provide tools we use as universal tools for all teams to use for their own products as well. In my short internship I didn't have the time to develop a software that could be used company wide, however I did make a product using tools available to anyone working at Amazon and wrote much documentation explaining how one could set up in the same way that I did. Overall a finished product was developed but as always it can definitly be expanded, and I hope to see a future iteration of it used everywhere. 

## Conclusion

This internship has been the most rewarding internship of my short undergraduate career, and I beleive is the perfect end to my co-op program. I have learned skills here that I can transfer anywhere and have had great experiences that have made me proud and happy that I have made the career choice of becoming a Software Engineer. 

## Acknowledgements

Big thank you to Peter, my manager, for providing great feedback during our meetings and for being a great person to talk to. Also want to mention the immense help given to me by George and Xuefeng, these guys are so smart and good at what they do, I wouldn't have gotten so far without them. Finally, huge thank you to Alfred, my mentor, who was very helpful and patient with me and guided me throughout the process.
